Need a way to protect and check parameters, like having limit sets for allowable parameters to prevent wrong-keys and case errors

needs more error checking and good messages for missing objects

YAML model loading

validation of many parameter types (maybe a validator annotation in ParameterGraph/ParameterObject)

allow single port bonds for photodiodes to activate outputs. Have port monitors
check when a port is missing if it can be activated
